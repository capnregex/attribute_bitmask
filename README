AttributeBitmask
================

Attribute Bitmask is designed to allow you to create accessor methods to access bitmask fields as if they were boolean attributes in the model. 


Example
=======

Simply declare an existing integer column as a bitmask with its possible values.

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  bitmask :roles, :writer, :publisher, :editor, :proofreader 
end

You can then access the bitmask fields as if they were boolean columns.

user = User.create(:name => "Bruce", :publisher => true, :editor => true)
user.publisher? 
# => true
user.writer?
# => false
user.writer = true
user.writer
# => true
user.writer?
# => true

user.roles
# => 7
